# `useInterval`

The `useInterval` hook is a custom React hook that allows you to repeatedly call a function with a
specified delay. It is useful for creating animations, timers, and other time-based effects in your
React component.

> Please note that browser timers may not be completely accurate. The delay between intervals that
> you specify is the minimum amount of time that will pass before the callback function is called
> again, but it may not be exactly that amount of time.

## Reference

```tsx
function useInterval(callback: () => void, ms?: number, enabled = true): void;
```

The `enabled` parameter in the `useInterval` hook determines whether the interval should be enabled
or not. If `enabled` is set to true (which is the default value), the interval will be set up and
the callback function will be called repeatedly at the specified `delay`. If `enabled` is set to
false, the interval will not be set up and the callback function will not be called. Any pending
intervals are cleared when `enabled` is set to false.

## Using the `useInterval` hook

In the following example the `useInterval` hook is used to increment the count state variable every
second. The `setCount` function is called on each interval to update the state and re-render the
component.

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useInterval(() => {
    // This counter works because a new closure is created every time the state is updated
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, 1000);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Creating an accurate timer

In the following example the `useInterval` hook is used to increment the count state variable every
second. A start date is stored in a ref so that the count can be calculated accurately.

```tsx
function MyComponent() {
  const startTimeRef = useRef(Date.now());
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useInterval(() => {
    setCount(Math.floor((Date.now() - startTimeRef.current) / 1000));
  }, 1000);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```
