  //
  // Shift will do capitals or other characters:
  // - shift+/ = ?, so '?' is the shortcut to register in that mode
  //
  // Alt/Option will do special characters:
  // - Alt+/ = รท, so 'รท' is the shortcut to register in that mode
  // - Alt+n = Dead Key for a ~ character above the next key, so cannot be used as a shortcut that way.
  //
  // Ctrl/Cmd should be fine, as they don't change the character that would be typed.
  //
  // Likely the `Command` type should be updated to add a `key` field, and both `key` and `code` should be optional.
  // Unless we can make one required based on the `mode` configuration.
