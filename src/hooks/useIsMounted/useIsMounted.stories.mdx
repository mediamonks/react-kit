# useIsMounted

Keeps track of whether the component is mounted, and returns a ref object that is updated
accordingly.

- `isMounted.current` is `false` before the component is mounted
- `isMounted.current` is `true` after the component is mounted
- `isMounted.current` is `false` during the unmount cleanup phase and after the component is
  unmounted

> Note that during the cleanup phase, the component is technically still mounted, even though the
ref object is updated to `false`. This is because the cleanup phase is executed before the
component is technically unmounted. However, since the logic during cleanup and after unmount is
often the same, this is not a problem.

The initial `false` state before the component is mounted can be useful to conditionally execute
some logic or render something. However, this hook will not cause a re-render, so it's best to use
alternative hooks mentioned below in case you need that.

The `false` state during and after the cleanup phase is useful for preventing memory leaks and
preventing state updates after the component is unmounted. This is often the case when using
`useEffect` with an async function, and the async function is still running after the component
is unmounted.

The state is set to `true` using a `queueMicrotask` callback, so it will be updated after all the
initial `useEffect` callbacks have been executed.

If the component uses a setState directly from a `useMount`, the component will rerender during the
mount phase, and the isMounted value will still be `false`.

> If the code you want to execute before mount is more isolated as a side effect, you can use the
`useBeforeMount` hook instead.

> If your code result is different before and after mount, and should execute again, you can use the
`useIsMountedState` hook instead.

> If you want to execute code after the component is **mounted**, you can use the `useMount` hook.

> If you want to execute code after the component is **unmounted**, you can use the `useUnmount`
hook.

## Reference

```ts
function useIsMounted(): RefObject<boolean>;
```

### Returns

* `RefObject<boolean>` - The current mounting state.
  - `false` before the component is mounted
  - `true` after the component is mounted
  - `false` during the unmount cleanup phase and after the component is unmounted

## Usage

```ts
const isMounted = useIsMounted();
console.log(isMounted.current); // false
```

Use after unmount in async functions, to prevent memory leaks and state updates after unmount.

```tsx
function DemoComponent() {
  const isMounted = useIsMounted();

  useMount(() => {
    fetchSomething().then(() => {
      // check if the component is still mounted after the async operation
      if (isMounted.current) {
        // do something with the result
      }
    });
  })

  return (
    <div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Use in `useEffect` cleanup, for some very specific scenarios.

```tsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
function DemoComponent() {
  const isMounted = useIsMounted();

  useEffect(() => {
    // do something

    return () => {
      if (isMounted.current) {
        // this is executed every time someChangingValue changes
      } else {
        // this is executed only once, when the component is unmounted
      }
    }
  }, [someChangingValue]);

  return (
    <div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
