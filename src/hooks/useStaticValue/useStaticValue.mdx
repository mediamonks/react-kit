# useStaticValue

Keep track of a value that is initialized once and then never changes. This is useful for values
that are expensive to calculate, but only need to be calculated once, or for values that would
create a new reference every time.

This behavior is similar to `useState`, but the value is never updated.

This is a better alternative to a `useMemo` without any dependencies.

## Reference

```ts
function useStaticValue<T>(initializeFunction: () => T): T;
```

### Parameters

* `initializeFunction` - Similar to `useState`, this function will be called to initialize the value.
  It will only be called once.

### Returns

* The value returned by `initializeFunction`, which will always be the same.

## Usage

```tsx
function DemoComponent() {
  const value = useStaticValue(() => ['foo', 'bar']);

  console.log('value', value);

  return null;
}
```
