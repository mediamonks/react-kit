# useBeforeMount

**Synchronously** run a function before the component is mounted, only once.

This is especially useful for initializing objects that are used in code further down.

It's opposite of `useMount`, which runs asynchronously after the component is mounted.

> To know when a component is rendering for the first time, use the `useIsMounted` hook,
which returned boolean ref can be used inline in other component code or JSX.

## Reference

```ts
function useBeforeMount(callback: () => void): void;
```

### Parameters

* `callback` - A function to be executed during the initial render, before mounting, but not
during subsequent renders.

## Usage

```tsx
function DemoComponent() {
  useBeforeMount(() => {
    console.log('I will run before the component is mounted');
  });

  return (
    <div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
