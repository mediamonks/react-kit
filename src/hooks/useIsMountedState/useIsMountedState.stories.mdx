# useIsMountedState

Exposes the mounted state that is updated after the component is mounted.

This hook uses `setState` to update the state after the component is mounted, which means that
the component will be re-rendered after the first render.

This hook is useful when you want to perform an action after the component is mounted, often used
when using SSR.
There, the initial render is executed on the server, and subsequent renders are executed on the
client. To prevent hydration errors, you want the first render on the client to be identical to
the render on the server. If you have state that is only available on the client, you can use
this hook to only render with the new state after the component is mounted.


## Reference

```ts
function useIsMountedState(): boolean;
```
### Returns

* `boolean` - The mounted state, `false` initially, and `true` after the component is mounted.

## Usage

```ts
const isMounted = useIsMountedState();
console.log(isMounted); // false
```

```tsx
```

Trigger a re-render after the component is mounted to update the state.

```tsx
function DemoComponent() {
  const isMounted = useIsMountedState();

  // help with SSR, since `isMounted` is part of the deps,
  // it will execute this `useMemo` again after the component is mounted
  // but now with state that is only known on the client
  const items = useMemo(() => {
    if (!isMounted) {
      return somethingSameAsServer(otherItems);
    }
    return somethingCustomOnTheClient(otherItems);
  }, [otherItems, isMounted]);

  return (
    <div>
      {items.map(item => <div>{item}</div>)}
      {/* this element is not rendered on the server, so had to be delayed on the client */}
      {isMounted && <div>Rendered only the client after mount</div>}
    </div>
  );
}
```
